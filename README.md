<p class="intro">This webpage is in experimental stage. This page is intended only for practice in Web Design but would also serve as a guide for my future work. This page would feature things that I enjoy doing as a hobby and if possible to be a career in the near future.
  
<p class="par1">This paragraph would cover my hobby on music and composition. On the right side would be a link to my soundcloud and in the near future my own youtube channel and fb page. I would also want my songs to be sang by dedicated singers who enjoys creating original music. Targeting an album release would be one of my goals for this. Featuring orignial, cover and rendition songs. Most of the songs might be in acoustic since my current studio is my room. LOL.</p>
  
<p class="par2">It just recently that I had started this hobby. I can’t event call it a hobby yet since I haven’t beend doing this again lately. This section would feature Macro photography with the use of a mobile phone and a Macro lens. I would have my collection of photos on this site and would be putting my instagram link along with it. I still need to figure out how to attach an album to this site. It would be great if the photos are interactive to. This is just a filler sentence to increase paragraph size</p>
  
  
<p class="par3">This section would feature my web design works. Maybe include an album for sample project page designs. Also released pages. Although this is just the first page I would be doing initially this would be the first on the list.
